# Logical Mechanics Research Program

## Core Hypothesis
**Logical consistency requirements constrain physical structure more fundamentally than typically recognized.** The universal absence of logical violations in physical reality represents an empirical constraint requiring physical explanation, comparable to conservation laws and symmetry principles.

## Research Question
**How much of physics reflects logical necessity versus empirical contingency?** Investigating whether logical constraints operate as physical limitations that shape the structure of physical theories.

## Methodology: Logic Constraint Sequence (LCS)
1. **Identify Logical Tensions** - Find physical setups where empirical facts create logical tensions
2. **Formalize Requirements** - Axiomatize 3FLL constraints and physical premises  
3. **Prove Mathematical Resolutions** - Show unique mathematical structures resolve tensions
4. **Derive Physical Consequences** - Demonstrate standard physics emerges from logical necessity
5. **Formal Verification** - Use Lean 4 to ensure rigorous derivations

## Current Status: Foundation Established ✅

### **Demonstrated Success Cases**
1. **Pauli Exclusion** - Distinct fermions + identical states → antisymmetric wavefunctions → exclusion
2. **Uncertainty Principle** - Finite capacity + definite measurements → information limits → uncertainty

### **Proven Methodology Components**
- Logical tension identification works systematically
- Mathematical resolutions are unique and rigorous  
- Physical consequences match standard quantum mechanics
- Formal verification prevents conceptual errors
- Pattern scales across different phenomena

## Research Trajectory

### **Phase 3: Empirical Testing (Future)**
- [ ] Design experiments testing logical constraint predictions
- [ ] Assess distinguishability from standard quantum mechanics
- [ ] Evaluate which aspects are empirically contingent vs. logically necessary
- [ ] Develop quantitative measures of logical constraint strength

### **Phase 4: Theoretical Integration (Long-term)**
