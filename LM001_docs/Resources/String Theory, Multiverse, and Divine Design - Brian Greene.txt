00:00 brian Green welcome to the show Thank
00:02 you so much The Elegant Universe turns
00:05 25 this year just like me Uh I wish I
00:09 could say that about myself I'd like to
00:12 get into what's changed where we're at
00:14 but I think it's going to require
00:16 starting with the question that I'm sure
00:18 you've never been asked before What is
00:20 string theory yes Uh good question
00:24 There are a number of ways of framing
00:26 what string theory is about but perhaps
00:28 from the largest perspective it's an
00:31 attempt to realize a dream that really
00:33 begins with Albert Einstein which is
00:36 this idea that we have a single universe
00:40 So we should have a single theoretical
00:42 explanation for how that universe works
00:45 And that single explanation should be
00:47 mathematical And so there should be some
00:49 grand mathematical formula some
00:52 mathematical equation that would
00:54 describe everything in the universe And
00:57 Einstein sought this so-called unified
00:59 theory for decades but he never found it
01:03 And string theory just may be the theory
01:07 that Einstein was looking for Now what
01:10 kinds of problems is the scientific
01:13 community faced with that leads them to
01:15 come up with something like string
01:17 theory i mean we already had a lot of
01:18 ideas about what the universe was made
01:20 of the different constituent particles
01:22 and stuff So where do we get this
01:23 vibrating strings thing yeah absolutely
01:26 So from my initial description it might
01:28 seem like it was more of an aesthetic or
01:31 a philosophical motivation to try to
01:33 find this unified theory But it goes far
01:35 deeper than that because there are these
01:38 two main ideas two main pillars that
01:42 support physics as we have understood it
01:44 since really the middle of the 20th
01:48 century And that is quantum physics
01:50 which describes the smallest things in
01:52 the world the elementary particles that
01:54 make up matter and Einstein's general
01:56 theory of relativity which really
01:58 describes the biggest things where
01:60 gravity matters stars galaxies black
02:02 holes the entire universe And the
02:06 problem is that even though quantum
02:08 mechanics works incredibly well in the
02:11 micro domain and general relativity
02:13 works incredibly well in the macro
02:15 domain whenever you try to put the two
02:18 mathematical theories together it breaks
02:20 down When you do any calculation that
02:23 blends the math of quantum mechanics and
02:25 the math of general relativity you get
02:27 one single answer And that answer is
02:29 infinity And infinity might sound well
02:33 that's kind of you know cool and poetic
02:35 sounding but it's
02:36 nonsensical in the context of physics
02:39 There's no quantity that you can measure
02:41 that's ever infinity So infinity is a
02:44 diagnostic which basically the
02:46 mathematics uses to kind of grab us by
02:50 the lapels and slap us in the face and
02:52 say you are doing something wrong You've
02:55 got to find a new description that puts
02:57 quantum mechanics and general relativity
02:59 together And that is what string theory
03:02 does at least in principle on paper And
03:06 I need to stress that this is not a
03:08 tested theory We don't know if it's
03:10 correct But mathematically for the first
03:12 time it does show a way of bridging the
03:15 gap between these two theories So does
03:18 this tell us that of general relativity
03:21 and quantum mechanics at least one of
03:23 them is sort of wrong i mean people
03:26 often talk about general relativity is
03:28 coming along to replace Isaac Newton's
03:31 understanding of gravity and they say
03:32 Newton was was kind of almost there but
03:34 but ultimately he was wrong Is that the
03:37 same approach we need to take of
03:39 something like general relativity as
03:40 well it is but I would caution to to see
03:44 it in that historical context that
03:46 you've just made reference to because
03:50 it's a little strong to say that Newton
03:52 was wrong I would say that any physical
03:56 theory that we ever write down is meant
03:59 to describe the universe in a certain
04:01 domain Mhm And when we gain better
04:05 equipment and when we make progress we
04:08 try to extend the domain of
04:10 applicability of our understanding And
04:13 when we do that we almost always find
04:16 that the ideas from the earlier
04:17 generation yes they really work in the
04:20 original domain but when you go beyond
04:22 that domain you need to update them You
04:24 need to replace them And so Newton did a
04:27 wonderful job at describing the orbits
04:29 of the planets General relativity comes
04:32 along and says "Well actually if you can
04:34 go a little bit further than just the
04:35 orbits of planets if you want to
04:37 understand more extreme environments
04:39 like black holes then you need these new
04:42 ideas of the general theory of
04:43 relativity." And that is indeed the
04:46 process that we feel we're likely
04:49 recapitulating now because when you try
04:52 to put quantum mechanics and general
04:53 relativity together you do find at least
04:57 in the string theoretic context that
04:59 general relativity has to yield to
05:02 additional terms additional mathematical
05:04 constructs that Einstein himself did not
05:07 write down And so yes as we try to go
05:10 beyond even the domain that Einstein
05:13 successfully described when we try to
05:15 put quantum theory into the story which
05:17 Einstein did not do we do find that
05:20 general relativity gets modified Now it
05:23 could also be that quantum mechanics
05:24 gets modified This is an idea that
05:26 people are talking about today So that
05:29 would again fit into exactly the same
05:31 template Earlier ideas when you try to
05:33 go further require new concepts new
05:36 ideas they have to be modified Do you
05:38 think that there is a sentimentality in
05:41 physics where people kind of want to
05:44 cling on to these famous revolutionary
05:47 ideas because as well as them being
05:50 really impressive as as theories they're
05:52 exciting You're familiar with them And
05:54 so when you're faced with something that
05:56 causes you to abandon something so
05:58 familiar do you think there is a
05:60 psychological barrier for a lot of
06:01 physicists i think it's really depending
06:04 on which physicist you're talking about
06:06 So are there some in the history of
06:10 physics where you can find reasonable
06:13 evidence that they were reluctant to
06:16 take the new step because they were so
06:19 tied to the old way of looking at things
06:22 Yes you can even in some way say that
06:25 about Einstein in some ways when quantum
06:27 mechanics came along and was suggesting
06:30 that the best you could ever do is
06:32 predict the likelihood the probability
06:34 of one or another outcome very different
06:36 from the classical perspective that
06:38 Einstein was used to where you tell
06:40 Einstein how things are today and
06:42 Einstein will tell you how they will be
06:44 tomorrow with 100% certainty coming from
06:47 the mathematical equations when quantum
06:49 mechanics began to chip away at that
06:52 picture yes is there some evidence that
06:54 Einstein resisted it absolutely but I
06:58 would say that the dominant perspective
07:00 of most physicists including Einstein
07:02 himself is that it is so exciting
07:05 exciting when there is a radically new
07:08 way of thinking about the world And so I
07:13 would say the
07:14 dominant way in which physicists
07:16 approach their work is that they look
07:19 for the opportunity to take us to a new
07:24 place And so while yeah I mean you know
07:27 we do get comfortable with certain ways
07:30 of thinking about things in the end of
07:31 the day most of us are all too happy to
07:35 be part of a revolution if that
07:37 revolution is well motivated by
07:39 experiment and theoretical calculations
07:43 So string theory what are the strings of
07:47 string theory yeah So when we get into
07:49 the details of this approach to put
07:52 quantum mechanics and general relativity
07:53 together we find that historically the
07:57 essential move was to say look the old
08:00 paradigm is that matter is made up of
08:03 these little particles electrons and
08:06 quarks little tiny dotlike structures
08:10 The new idea of string theory was to say
08:12 what if they're not little dots what if
08:14 they are extended little filaments what
08:17 if if you took a powerful microscope and
08:20 you looked into the heart of matter and
08:22 you didn't find a swarm of little dots
08:25 but you found a swarm of little
08:27 vibrating
08:28 filaments And the motivation for that
08:31 came from the fact that with that move
08:35 the tension between quantum mechanics
08:37 and general relativity went away Mhm
08:40 That little tiny move from dot to
08:42 filament was what you needed for the
08:44 mathematics of these two theories to
08:45 harmoniously meld together So if this
08:49 picture is correct the electron would be
08:51 a little vibrating filament and the
08:54 quirks they would be little vibrating
08:57 filaments and the different vibrational
08:59 patterns like the different musical
09:01 notes on a musical string would
09:04 correspond to the different particles
09:05 that make up the world So it's kind of
09:07 like the universe becomes this
09:11 microscopic cosmic symphony of vibrating
09:14 film It's a very beautiful and poetic
09:16 picture that we can make rigorous and
09:19 mathematical and mathematically
09:20 beautiful as well So I keep getting told
09:23 I'm not a mathematician I couldn't
09:24 possibly vouch for it But it does sound
09:26 a little bit like I mean you told me a
09:28 second ago that string theory hasn't
09:29 been proven It's not been sort of
09:32 experimentally verified I was under the
09:34 impression that the thing that was so
09:36 great about the scientific enterprise
09:38 physics is that we can do that We can we
09:41 can have hypothesis We can test them We
09:44 make predictions and if those
09:45 predictions come true that's how we know
09:47 we've got a good theory This sounds a
09:49 little bit like it's working in the
09:50 opposite direction We've got this
09:52 problem and here's a mathematical way of
09:54 thinking about it that will plug in
09:56 those gaps But is that an appropriate
09:59 way to be doing science well I would say
10:01 it's not really going against the grain
10:03 of what we always do It's more that the
10:07 time scales involved for being able to
10:10 check the mathematical predictions are
10:12 much longer Even in this case we don't
10:15 know how long they will be compared to
10:17 things in the past So take Einstein and
10:20 his special theory of relativity There
10:23 was a real puzzle that he faced which
10:25 had to do with properties of light and
10:28 its motion He wrote down some
10:30 mathematical ideas just out of his head
10:33 and thinking about the data and the
10:35 situation and very quickly those ideas
10:39 could be tested In the general theory of
10:41 relativity 10 years later he writes down
10:44 equations to try to gain some insight
10:47 into problems to do with the force of
10:49 gravity Within four years you could test
10:53 those predictions through the solar
10:55 eclipse of May 1919 There's a four-year
10:57 gap between the math and say the
10:59 confirmation Here we are with string
11:02 theory and I don't know exactly where
11:05 you want to date the theory from but
11:07 give it sort of you know 30 years or
11:10 something 40 years and we haven't been
11:12 able to test it So the time scale is
11:14 longer Will we test it in 50 or 100 i
11:18 don't know It really depends on how
11:19 quickly our mathematics continues to
11:21 develop and importantly how quickly our
11:24 technology continues to develop That's
11:27 really part of the problem here any
11:30 theory I don't care if it's string
11:32 theory or loop quantum gravity another
11:35 approach that people have developed If
11:37 it's putting gravity and quantum
11:39 mechanics together it will distinguish
11:43 itself in realms that are incredibly
11:46 tiny or incredibly massive That's where
11:49 the tension between general relativity
11:51 and quantum mechanics surfaces And so
11:54 you're going to have to have experiments
11:55 that can probe incredibly small or
11:58 incredibly energetic realms And we are
12:02 reaching I wouldn't say the limit but a
12:05 challenge to go beyond say the large
12:07 hadron collider in Geneva Switzerland We
12:09 used to have small colliders bigger
12:11 bigger now we've got this 18 mile ind
12:14 you know circumference uh you know
12:16 accelerator How much bigger can you get
12:19 and we don't know that we can get to the
12:21 scales necessary to test these ideas
12:24 Because if you naively look at how big
12:26 the accelerator would need to be it
12:28 would need to be as big as the galaxy
12:31 That's how much we've leapfrogged
12:34 mathematically And that's what
12:37 distinguishes this situation from say
12:40 special relativity or general relativity
12:41 or the standard model of particle
12:43 physics Well
12:45 how is it possible in principle even if
12:48 we did have some galactic you know
12:52 collider how do we experimentally
12:54 confirm that all fundamental matter
12:57 breaks down into into vibrating strings
12:59 how does that It's a key question And if
13:02 you allow me to imagine that we had
13:06 arbitrarily energetic equipment
13:09 arbitrarily able to probe to
13:11 increasingly small scales or maybe we
13:15 talked to an alien civilization and
13:17 they've cracked this problem Are there
13:19 tests of string theory yeah String
13:21 theory says that if you were to slam
13:24 particles together at sufficiently high
13:26 energies we would see things that string
13:29 theory predicts that you would not see
13:32 in more conventional approaches And we
13:34 can write down what those features would
13:37 be So in principle they would be
13:39 testable Those are like new kinds of
13:41 particles New kinds of particles the way
13:44 in which the particles slam and bounce
13:46 off of each other the so-called
13:48 scattering amplitudes they're different
13:51 in this approach than they would be in a
13:53 more conventional approach And so there
13:56 are diagnostic tests that in principle
13:60 we could carry out if we had this
14:02 arbitrarily powerful equipment which we
14:05 do not have We'll get back to Brian
14:07 Green in just a moment but first do you
14:09 trust the news i don't And a lot of that
14:12 has got to do with the bias that
14:13 inevitably seeps into reporting Wouldn't
14:15 it be great if there were a way for us
14:17 as consumers of news in this media
14:19 landscape to navigate bias objectively
14:22 comparing the way that different sources
14:24 are reporting on the same story Well
14:26 luckily that is exactly what today's

15:20 Brian Green What do you think Einstein
15:21 would have made of string theory well I
15:23 think at first he would have resisted it
15:26 a bit because it does involve some
15:31 pretty far out ideas And so as you were
15:34 saying it does take a while for even
15:38 psychologically people to acclimatize to
15:42 a different way of thinking about things
15:44 But I have little doubt that if Einstein
15:47 took the time and I think that he would
15:48 to sit down and learn about these ideas
15:51 the fact that it involves his own
15:53 general theory of relativity the fact
15:55 that it does incorporate quantum physics
15:57 which he resisted but ultimately
15:59 recognized was a powerful way of
16:01 describing the world the fact that it
16:03 involves extra dimensions of space an
16:06 idea that Einstein himself spent some
16:09 time thinking about All of these
16:12 ingredients I think ultimately Einstein
16:14 would find exciting and mathematically I
16:17 think he would be bowled over by the
16:20 beautiful way in which string theory
16:21 brings it all together I do think he
16:25 would ask the very same question that
16:26 you did How do you test this how do we
16:29 know that this isn't just pure
16:31 mathematics and that would take us into
16:34 a wonderful conversation along the lines
16:36 of the material that we just discussed
16:38 So yeah I think he would warm to these
16:40 ideas pretty quickly Do you think we're
16:42 sort of in the realm of philosophy here
16:44 one of the criticisms that I see of
16:45 string theory as somebody who doesn't
16:47 understand the first thing about it is
16:50 that because of this lack of
16:51 experimental
16:52 data you can say that in principle it
16:54 could be tested But there are all kinds
16:56 of philosophical theories that in
16:57 principle we could test Ideas about
16:60 personal identity or Star Trek
17:02 teleporters and would the person still
17:04 be the same person if you reconstructed
17:06 all of their atoms I can I can sort of
17:07 hypothesize a way to test that in in
17:09 principle but because that is so
17:11 far-fetched it's squarely in the realm
17:13 of philosophy rather than science Do you
17:15 think that string theory for that reason
17:16 might belong there at least for now too
17:18 well I guess two quick things One there
17:20 are some who would view a
17:24 categorization of being in the
17:26 philosophical domain as somehow
17:30 denigrating the ideas And I don't see it
17:33 that way at all I mean if we are in a
17:36 philosophical realm
17:38 fantastic philosophy is wonderful up if
17:41 you ask me Yeah Yeah Exactly So you know
17:43 so I I don't view that as some kind of a
17:45 black mark against physical theory If it
17:48 raises philosophical questions but
17:50 you're saying something slightly
17:51 different You're saying because we can't
17:53 directly test it Should it be called
17:56 science perhaps we can frame it that way
17:59 And I think the answer to that is
18:00 absolutely yes Because science is not
18:04 about ideas that can be put forward and
18:07 then tested immediately Science about
18:10 putting forward ideas that solve
18:12 critical problems that can be tested at
18:15 least in principle at some point And
18:18 that's really important because if you
18:20 put forward an idea that's meant to be
18:23 scientific but someone can establish you
18:26 can't possibly in any way shape or form
18:30 ever test that idea then it's hard to
18:32 see that it fits within the
18:34 categorization of science But if you put
18:37 forward an idea which at least in
18:38 principle you could test if you had the
18:41 right equipment then to me if it solves
18:44 certain key problems if it advances your
18:47 understanding theoretically of things
18:49 like black holes and the big bang and
18:52 the nature of space and the nature of
18:54 time which is what string theory does
18:56 then it's absolutely worth your
18:59 investigating it And it absolutely falls
19:01 squarely in the realm of science But it
19:04 also raises certain problems as well as
19:06 solving problems right yeah I mean there
19:08 are problems in the sense of just
19:09 counterintuitive implications like I
19:12 don't know how many dimensions is it
19:13 that we're supposed to believe in these
19:15 days 11 12 you know 30 I think it 11's a
19:18 good number Yes Depends who you ask
19:20 Which
19:21 typically is quite difficult for people
19:23 to imagine um and to swallow Although as
19:26 far as I understand it there's something
19:28 about the way that strings vibrating in
19:30 these dimensions uh there's something
19:32 about that which would produce the long
19:36 sought after graviton particle right and
19:38 and so scientists for a long time have
19:40 expected that there would be this
19:41 particle called the graviton which is
19:43 like the the fundamental unit of gravity
19:46 And if you do the maths for string
19:48 theory you predict this graviton And so
19:51 when people say that string theory has
19:53 no predictive power it's like okay we
19:56 haven't made a prediction of something
19:57 that we don't know if it exists yet and
19:58 then found it It does predict one
20:01 important thing which is the existence
20:02 of gravity because we've known that
20:04 gravity's existed for a long time but
20:06 right we haven't actually been able to
20:07 to find it in the way that maybe string
20:09 theory can Right Yeah So I mean I'm fond
20:12 of taking that line of discussion too
20:15 but I think of it more as a postdiction
20:18 rather than a prediction for the very
20:20 reason that you mentioned We've known
20:22 about gravity Isaac Newton wrote down a
20:25 mathematical understanding of gravity
20:27 But if you imagine a counterfactual
20:30 universe for instance a universe in
20:32 which there was no Einstein and we did
20:35 not have Einstein's general theory of
20:37 relativity and yet somehow people came
20:39 upon string theory and they began to
20:42 study the mathematics of string theory
20:44 within the math of string theory a
20:46 clever string theorist would extract the
20:49 general theory of relativity Wow And so
20:52 that feels very gratifying Yeah That
20:56 these ideas hold together with such a
20:59 rich and and powerful cohesiveness And
21:02 you're absolutely right because quantum
21:05 mechanics is also part of string theory
21:08 It wouldn't just be the general theory
21:10 of relativity It would be the quantum
21:12 version of the general theory of
21:14 relativity which does involve these
21:16 particles called gravitons So string
21:18 theory naturally does give rise to the
21:21 quantum mechanical carrier of the
21:23 gravitational force which is the
21:25 graviton But look I need to emphasize no
21:27 one's ever detected a graviton It's the
21:30 smallest particle of the weakest of all
21:33 forces So we're not surprised that it's
21:36 been a challenge to ever capture a
21:39 graviton and detect it directly We're
21:41 not surprised by that But it is a
21:43 beautiful thing that this idea that
21:46 predates string theory naturally yields
21:50 the very same structure when you study
21:53 the math of string theory That's in the
21:55 maths That's that's the interesting
21:56 thing Now one thing that I'm a little
21:60 bit confused about is how
22:02 something about these different
22:04 dimensions and the different ways that
22:07 they could could exist the different
22:08 sort of structures that they could have
22:10 I'm not sure if it's related to the
22:12 dimensions themselves or the shapes or
22:14 whatever but I hear a lot of people talk
22:15 about how string about how string theory
22:18 points towards this explosion of
22:21 multiple universes some kind of
22:23 multiverse picture I don't know if it
22:24 produces like a a potentially infinite
22:27 number of universes or if it's like some
22:29 precise number of
22:31 700,046 when you actually do the
22:33 calculation but something about lots of
22:35 universes Yeah So when I was a graduate
22:38 student way back in the 1980s long
22:42 before you were born and I began to work
22:45 on string theory the aspect that caught
22:48 my attention was its need for these
22:51 extra dimensions of space And briefly
22:54 when you study the math of string theory
22:55 there's an equation and the equation
22:58 cannot be solved if there aren't these
23:00 extra dimensions of space So that's
23:02 where the idea does come from And when I
23:06 was a graduate student people began to
23:08 think about what those extra dimensions
23:10 of space might look like The idea is
23:12 that they're very small They're crumpled
23:15 They're all around us but they're so
23:17 tiny that we can't directly see them the
23:19 way we can directly see you know left
23:22 right back forth and up down right the
23:24 three dimensions of common experience
23:26 And so if they're crumpled up what's the
23:29 shape into which they are crumpled
23:32 and in the 1980 mid1 1980s scientists
23:36 mathematicians wrote down five possible
23:40 shapes And at that point people thought
23:43 those might be the only possible shapes
23:45 that would meet the mathematical
23:47 requirements So as a graduate student I
23:50 started to study those shapes to see
23:52 what physics they might give rise to And
23:54 that's what my doctoral dissertation was
23:57 all about And that seemed kind of a
23:59 beautiful thing a small number of
24:01 possibilities Maybe we can either rule
24:03 them all out and get rid of string
24:05 theory or maybe one of them describes
24:07 our world and wow that would be amazing
24:10 The problem is as you made reference to
24:12 as people began to study the math
24:14 further and further five possible shapes
24:17 grew to six grew to 10 grew to a million
24:21 grew to a billion grew to a trillion
24:24 grew to 10 to the 500 M that little list
24:28 of five possible shapes is now an
24:31 enormous list of possibilities And so
24:34 what do you do with that well one idea
24:37 that people put forward is maybe all of
24:40 them are real in the sense that all of
24:43 them are realized in the sense that
24:46 there are many
24:47 universes in which each of those shapes
24:51 constitutes the extra dimensions in that
24:53 universe Yeah And this is an idea that
24:56 really was spearheaded by Leonard Suskin
24:59 who was thinking about these ideas in
25:01 the context of inflationary cosmology
25:04 and in the context of a puzzle called
25:06 the cosmological constant problem And
25:08 when he put all these ideas together it
25:11 naturally should suggested that maybe
25:13 there are multiple big bangs yielding
25:16 multiple universes each with a different
25:20 shape for the extra dimensions That's
25:22 where this multiverse comes from And
25:24 that's because of the the possibility of
25:27 different ways that these dimensions
25:30 could be could be shaped and
25:32 organized to me I mean that that is of
25:35 course really interesting but a lot of
25:37 people will listen to that and think
25:40 what if there's just some other reason
25:42 why the dimensions are as they are in
25:45 our actual universe i mean the fact that
25:47 a bunch of other realities are
25:48 mathematically possible doesn't mean
25:50 that they actually exist Yes Is positing
25:53 that they just do exist just sort of a
25:56 convenient way to get around the problem
25:57 of explaining why the universe is the
25:59 way it is Yes that is certainly a
26:01 possible way that this story might
26:05 ultimately be told
26:08 And it could be that there is some
26:11 mathematical equation that we've yet to
26:14 find And when you look at that
26:16 mathematical equation you solve it Maybe
26:18 it says ah that's the shape shape
26:23 22,462 Maybe that will come out of some
26:25 fundamental mathematical calculation At
26:28 which point we'll say all the other
26:29 shapes were speurious They were
26:33 potential shapes when we didn't know
26:35 about this other mathematical condition
26:38 But with this new condition they're gone
26:40 and there just this one shape And that
26:42 would be a very beautiful resolution to
26:44 all of this We've yet to find anything
26:47 like that equation Would we have to rule
26:50 out those possibilities because s such
26:52 an equation would say that all of these
26:55 trillions of other potential ways of
26:57 organizing the universe actually can't
26:59 obtain Uh we just didn't realize it
27:02 before Would we have to show its
27:03 impossibility in that sense to show that
27:06 it didn't in fact exist or is there a
27:08 world in which we can prove actually
27:09 they are all definitely possible and yet
27:12 we know that they don't exist sure it
27:14 could just be historical contingency If
27:17 we understood the origin of the universe
27:19 better and if we understood the
27:21 dynamical processes by which the
27:24 universe evolved from however it began
27:27 to its current state of being Maybe when
27:30 we just look at that history we go "Oh
27:32 oh look that shape is picked out by the
27:35 historical progression The others are
27:38 possible They solve the equations
27:40 they're just not realized because of the
27:42 particular set of steps that took us
27:45 from the beginning until today That's
27:46 another possibility But I do want to
27:48 emphasize that when when Suskime was
27:50 thinking about this he was thinking
27:54 dynamically because when you look at
27:57 this approach to cosmology called
27:60 inflationary cosmology you find within
28:03 it very naturally that our big bang was
28:06 not a one-time event You find very
28:09 naturally from the mathematics that our
28:11 big bang would be one of many big bangs
28:15 giving rise to one of many
28:18 universes And Suskin simply said if we
28:21 port that idea from inflationary
28:23 cosmology into string theory then very
28:26 naturally those distinct big bangs could
28:29 have distinct shapes for the extra
28:30 dimensions
28:32 M man
28:34 So I'm thinking there's something quite
28:38 profound underlying all of this and all
28:40 of these considerations And what's
28:43 coming to mind for me is that you talked
28:46 before a little bit about these
28:47 particles these potential gravitons but
28:51 also have quarks or quarks or however
28:53 you want to say it And you've got
28:54 nutrinos and you've got electrons And
28:57 part of the story of science is trying
28:58 to explain why that is the way that it
29:01 is I mean so much of science is
29:02 descriptive right like we we look inside
29:06 of an atom and we find that it's made of
29:08 protons neutrons and electrons and we
29:11 feel that thereby we've sort of
29:13 explained something like we understand
29:16 the atom whereas as far as I'm concerned
29:19 all we've really done is just described
29:20 it in further detail and we haven't
29:22 really shifted the needle on the
29:23 question of why it is that way rather
29:26 than another So when we look in the
29:30 quantum realm and we find these very
29:31 specific set of particles and not other
29:33 particles they've got particular weights
29:35 and not other
29:36 weights Why is that the case why not
29:39 some other set of particles with a
29:41 different set of properties yeah And and
29:43 so it really comes down
29:45 to what do you want science to do m
29:51 Neils Boore the grand master of quantum
29:55 physics would say all you want science
29:58 to do is give you some mathematical
30:00 explanation for the readouts in your
30:03 equipment You take a measurement you get
30:06 a result Can you explain that number you
30:09 don't need to explain anything about the
30:11 nature of reality You don't have to tell
30:14 a narrative of how things are Can you
30:16 explain those numbers now many of us
30:19 think that that's a too limited way of
30:21 looking at science I'm more in the camp
30:24 that you describe I want to feel like I
30:27 can tell some coherent story that gives
30:30 me some understanding of not only how
30:33 things are but why they are this way Now
30:37 we've been really good at the how so far
30:40 because we have the standard model of
30:43 particle physics that can describe the
30:45 results that come out of every
30:47 experiment at the Large Hadron Collider
30:49 gives us an understanding of the
30:51 structure of matter Gives us an
30:53 understanding of how that matter can
30:55 ultimately coales when you put
30:56 Einstein's ideas together into stars and
30:59 galaxies and into planets That's all
31:02 pretty good But if you then said to me
31:04 but in that theory you've made certain
31:07 assumptions Yes you assume there's
31:08 electrons
31:10 neutrinos why those particles and not
31:12 others And that really comes down to the
31:16 question that Einstein really asked in a
31:18 way Is there a unique universe that
31:22 somehow is logically required to be and
31:26 any deviation from that universe would
31:29 somehow be logically inconsistent
31:32 einstein said did God have any choice in
31:37 creating the universe could God
31:40 therefore in other words have created
31:43 the universe differently or was God's
31:45 choices fixed by some sort of master
31:49 logic that we've yet to
31:51 uncover i would love if we find that
31:53 logic We're nowhere near that As of
31:56 today is it possible logically and
31:59 mathematically that there would be a
32:01 universe that has vastly different
32:03 particles from the ones that we know
32:05 about i think so Is it possible that we
32:07 could be in a universe where it was all
32:10 Newton no quantum mechanics Is that a
32:12 logically possible i think it is Now
32:16 people will argue about this but I don't
32:19 think that we have any criteria at the
32:21 moment where we can say "Ah the universe
32:24 had to have quantum mechanics It had to
32:25 have general relativity has to have
32:27 electrons and quirks." There's no other
32:29 reality that could possibly have been
32:32 realized We're nowhere near that goal
32:34 but it would be wonderful to get there
32:38 And ultimately frankly we'd like to go
32:40 one step further and answer Linets's
32:44 question Why is there something rather
32:47 than nothing nothing seems to be
32:50 logically possible too And by nothing I
32:52 don't mean and neither did Linets empty
32:55 space I mean nothing No space no space
32:60 no time no nothing that seems to be
33:02 logically possible and yet clearly we're
33:06 not in that
33:07 reality Why not yes that to me is is the
33:11 foundational question in the sense that
33:13 it's really kind of naive and simple
33:15 like a kid can ask it but it's also like
33:18 the most profound philosophical question
33:20 that you come back to regardless of how
33:22 much study you do I am suspicious about
33:26 the extent to which science can inform a
33:28 question like that An analogy that I've
33:31 given before is a bit like discovering a
33:34 book There are some books on the table
33:36 uh which are also available on
33:37 Amazon.com and reputable book sellers
33:40 everywhere Um but suppose it were a a
33:43 book of poetry on the table I use the
33:46 example of a Shakespearean set a a book
33:49 of his sets and we just discovered this
33:51 book and we wanted to know what it's
33:54 doing there What what is it what's it
33:55 made of right and so we start studying
33:57 it We start looking inside and some
33:59 clever person begins to notice that it
34:02 follows certain patterns At the end of
34:05 these things called sentences there's
34:06 always a a period a full stop right and
34:09 there are these big versions of letters
34:11 and little versions of letters And you
34:13 discover this law of capitalization And
34:16 then the really clever person realizes
34:18 that when you pronounce these words it
34:19 follows this this
34:21 rhythmun dun dun And they call it iiamic
34:23 pentameter because you know it sounds
34:25 fancy But they've identified this this
34:27 law of amic pentameter that everything
34:29 everything
34:30 follows And somebody says "Look we're
34:33 discovering all of these laws of this
34:35 book Isn't it amazing?" And I'm still
34:37 left with the question of why is the
34:40 book there why does it follow those laws
34:42 why was it written in the first place
34:43 and for somebody to say to me well we
34:46 don't know yet but look at all the
34:48 progress we're making Look at look at
34:49 how much we've discovered Look at how
34:51 many laws we've uncovered Surely at some
34:54 point we'll get there That would be a
34:56 category error right because you're
34:58 never going to push the laws of literacy
34:60 enough to understand the origin of the
35:02 text And I wonder if there's an analogy
35:03 here when we look at the laws of physics
35:06 and we discover the way that planets
35:08 orbit each other and stuff and we're
35:09 finding all these wonderful descriptions
35:10 of how everything works Is it a category
35:13 error to suggest that if we just push
35:15 that kind of thinking far enough we'll
35:17 get the answer to the origin of the
35:18 universe it could be I don't think it is
35:23 but I need to qualify it in in two ways
35:26 Number one I would say what physics is
35:29 about and how it differs from your
35:33 analogy with the sonnet is that physics
35:36 is about
35:38 finding a
35:39 description that involves far less input
35:44 and far less information than the things
35:47 that comes out of it the ultimate
35:50 description of what's going on So when
35:53 we look at quantum phenomenon there is
35:56 so much stuff that happens in the
35:58 microscopic world Particles slamming
36:00 into each other joining together into
36:03 atoms and into molecules So we can
36:05 describe the fundamental processes with
36:08 a few lines of mathematics So that
36:12 complex amalgamation of processes is
36:15 reduced to a few symbols on a piece of
36:18 paper It is ultimately just a
36:20 description of what's going on But it is
36:22 a very efficient and effective
36:25 description And it's so good that when
36:27 we use the math to calculate for
36:30 instance magnetic properties of
36:32 electrons we can make a calculation to
36:36 14 decimal places and then we do the
36:39 experiment and it agrees digit by digit
36:42 by digit to 14 decimal places You can't
36:45 help but think that that's more than
36:47 just a mere repackaging or a mere
36:50 observation about the patterns you're
36:53 somehow finding something at the heart
36:56 of the patterns when you can make that
36:58 kind of a leap from mathematics to
37:01 predictions But I would say that I do
37:03 differ from my colleagues in a way
37:06 that's relevant to the analogy that you
37:08 give which is the
37:10 following The sonnet I think we'd all
37:13 agree is a human construct Y the
37:16 description that you gave in terms of
37:18 capital letters small letters
37:20 periods,amic pentameter those are all
37:24 human inventions You can use the word
37:26 that you did use discovering these
37:29 patterns You are discovering them but
37:32 the patterns were human inventions
37:34 And I think that what we're doing in
37:36 mathematics is really just inventing
37:40 human inventions a language that's
37:43 really good at encapsulating the
37:45 patterns not found in a sonnet but the
37:47 patterns found in nature And so I don't
37:51 think that we are discovering laws even
37:53 though in loose language I often do say
37:56 that I think we are inventing laws We're
37:59 inventing the math We're inventing the
38:01 symbols We're inventing the operations
38:04 and we are inventing the equations and
38:06 finding wow these equations are really
38:10 good at encapsulating those patterns In
38:12 fact they're so good that we can use the
38:14 equations to make predictions about
38:15 patterns we haven't even yet seen And
38:18 then we do go out and we see them So it
38:21 is powerful but ultimately I think that
38:24 what we're doing is inventing things So
38:27 now back to your key question could that
38:30 invention ultimately give us answers to
38:33 these profound philosophical questions
38:37 and I think that they can point the way
38:39 because the equations are good at
38:42 finding the patterns encapsulating the
38:44 patterns And if you believe that reality
38:47 for reasons that we don't understand
38:49 does follow patterns did God infuse
38:52 those patterns are they somehow written
38:55 into some ultimate description of a
38:59 universe that has to be them i don't
39:01 know But if you believe that there are
39:03 these patterns and we've invented a
39:05 language that's really good at talking
39:07 about those patterns then yeah in
39:09 principle maybe that language can point
39:11 us toward the ultimate pattern which may
39:15 give insight into why there's a universe
39:16 at all H patterns is a really
39:19 interesting way of describing it because
39:21 I wanted to know what your view is on
39:24 what a law of physics is The these words
39:28 like laws these words like forces the
39:31 force of gravity they're thrown around
39:33 without people stopping to think about
39:34 what they're actually saying there I
39:36 mean to say that there is a law of
39:39 physics that word seems to imply that
39:42 there is this written rule somewhere
39:44 that everything is following The
39:46 question that got me thinking about this
39:48 when I was younger was to ask like do
39:50 things fall to the ground because of the
39:52 law of gravity or do we have the law of
39:54 gravity because things fall to the
39:56 ground and it seems more sensible to me
39:58 to suggest that like like you indicate
40:00 we are essentially describing patterns
40:03 that we see And the great observation of
40:05 David Hume was to was to realize that
40:08 that is just something that we observe
40:10 and describe He he looked everywhere he
40:13 could for the causal connection between
40:16 hitting a billyard ball and that
40:17 billiard ball going forward And he
40:19 thought there's nothing in principle
40:20 logically like preventing me hitting
40:23 that billyard ball and it flying upwards
40:26 instead of forwards except for this
40:28 thing that we observe called you
40:30 causation But he looked for it
40:32 everywhere and he just couldn't find it
40:34 Yeah But he said I still believe in it
40:36 though I still believe in causation I
40:38 just have absolutely no way to justify
40:42 its existence And the problem for Hume
40:44 is that the way that Bertin Russell put
40:45 it was uh in this problem of induction
40:48 was to say like if you were a chicken
40:50 and every single day the farmer comes in
40:53 and throws your seed right and and so
40:55 the chicken develops this this
40:58 connection between the farmer coming in
41:00 and the food being given in the same way
41:02 that every time I've seen an object be
41:04 dropped it's fallen to the ground So I
41:05 developed this idea of a causal
41:07 connection just because every time I've
41:08 seen it that's what's happened And
41:09 Russell's like "Well the chicken will in
41:12 the same way develop a causal connection
41:14 between the farmer coming in and the
41:15 food being given." But until the hatchet
41:18 comes quite right until the hatchet
41:20 comes and the chicken's dead and we
41:22 realized that the chicken was just
41:23 identifying patterns but there was no
41:25 actual law It feels ridiculous to
41:27 suggest that the laws of physics could
41:29 work in the same way because it's
41:31 happened so many times Yeah you know
41:34 every single time we've ever seen this
41:35 kind of stuff But like is there this
41:38 thing called a law that that makes sure
41:40 it happens or are we just describing
41:41 patterns and and look so I would say
41:44 number one
41:46 when I was younger if we had this
41:48 conversation when I was your tender age
41:52 I would sit here and say "Yeah there are
41:54 laws of physics." Yes When we write down
41:57 these mathematical laws they are why the
42:00 universe behaves the way it does And
42:03 that was so naive as I look back at my
42:07 25year-old self thinking that way
42:10 because number one obviously laws that
42:13 we write down change over time So so
42:16 number one we have to recognize it's all
42:18 provisionals but even more deeply in the
42:21 end of the day what we humans do we are
42:25 able to access a tiny part of reality We
42:29 find patterns in the part that we have
42:31 access to and we invent this language
42:34 that does a really good job at
42:35 describing it And that's really I think
42:37 all that there is to it But having said
42:41 that I'm not precisely sure the language
42:44 and I always struggle at this point to
42:46 find the right words I do think that
42:50 within the fundamental architecture of
42:53 reality there are
42:56 certain inbuilt patterns that do guide
43:01 the dynamics that do guide the billyard
43:04 ball as it slams into another billyard
43:06 ball I don't think it's Newton's laws I
43:08 don't think it's the laws of quantum
43:09 physics I don't think it's general
43:10 relativity But I do within the
43:12 architecture of reality feel that there
43:15 is something that requires this kind of
43:18 regularity Now is that a law i'm not
43:21 sure if that's the right language any
43:23 longer because the universe just does
43:25 what it does Particles move and bill
43:28 your balls slam into and they don't care
43:30 about quantum mechanics or the laws of
43:32 physics as we articulate them They're
43:35 just doing their business and they've
43:37 been doing that business long before we
43:39 existed and they will be doing their
43:41 business long after we are gone And so
43:44 in that sense the universe just is and
43:47 just does and just evolves But I do
43:49 think there's a fundamental regularity
43:52 that guides how things progress Do we
43:55 have access to that regularity is math
43:58 the right language for articulating that
44:02 regularity i have absolutely no idea and
44:05 I don't have any reason to believe that
44:07 it is I do know that it does a really
44:09 good job at approximating those
44:12 regularities which is why we can make
44:14 predictions that so closely match
44:16 observation But does that mean that
44:18 we've actually uncovered the true
44:21 fundamental regularities of reality that
44:24 to me would be a miracle Would that be
44:26 something material in your view i mean
44:28 you you I tend to agree with you that
44:30 there is something about the nature of
44:32 reality that I don't think gravity is
44:35 going to switch off in 5 seconds But
44:37 then you know let's not tempt the gods I
44:39 do think that there's something pulling
44:43 this all together But if we're talking
44:45 about the thing that governs the
44:46 interactions of all material objects
44:48 essentially does that governing thing
44:50 itself have to step outside of
44:52 materiality and we get into this realm
44:54 which physicists often dare not tread of
44:57 of talking about immaterial influence on
45:00 material things yeah Look well two three
45:04 quick things Number one we've looked at
45:06 the universe by using powerful
45:10 telescopes way back
45:12 to few hundred,000 years after the big
45:15 bang So say we've looked at it through a
45:17 13 billion year
45:18 span That may seem like a long period of
45:21 time but we can extrapolate into the far
45:25 future and there's every reason to
45:26 believe that this cosmos of ours will
45:28 exist in one form or another for 10 to
45:30 the hundred years if not longer into the
45:32 future Which means that we could be like
45:35 the chicken and for 13 billion years
45:38 we've seen the regularity but maybe you
45:40 know 10 to the hundred years from now
45:44 the hatchet comes and we realize oh we
45:47 were just confused by the patterns that
45:49 held true for such a long period of time
45:51 So is it possible that gravity will
45:53 switch off probably not in 5 seconds but
45:56 we're looking at a tiny region of time
45:59 compared to the entirety that might
46:00 happen Number one Number two do we step
46:03 outside of
46:05 materiality look I'm open to that idea I
46:09 would be thrilled if that were the
46:13 ultimate answer How remarkable if there
46:17 is some grand non-physical entity that
46:20 is responsible for the universe and the
46:22 fact that we're here I would love to
46:24 learn about that and it would be
46:26 enormously exciting The problem as a
46:29 physicist is I can't go any further than
46:32 that excitement I can't analyze it I
46:35 can't investigate it I can't write down
46:37 mathematical equations By definition it
46:39 stands outside the physical the thing
46:40 that a physicist focuses upon So I don't
46:43 find it that interesting I don't say it
46:46 is impossible It just doesn't occupy my
46:50 attention when I can't go any further in
46:54 the analysis And so my perspective has
46:56 been to say sure maybe but now I'm put
46:59 that to the side and see how far I can
47:02 get just focusing on the physical just
47:05 focusing on the tools that we have
47:07 developed and the fact that we've been
47:09 able to go as far as we've been able is
47:12 is deeply thrilling M one of the most
47:17 celebrated descriptions of the universe
47:19 that has uh come
47:22 about of late and by of late I mean in
47:25 the history of the scientific enterprise
47:27 is this surprising fact that so much of
47:30 what governs our
47:32 universe the the strength of various
47:34 laws for example the mass of various
47:37 particles are so finely tuned that some
47:41 theorists do suggest the multiverse we
47:43 were talking about earlier to the extent
47:45 that like the only way to explain the
47:47 fact that it could have been so many
47:48 ways and is this way is that this is
47:51 just one of many
47:52 universes Another suggestion for that
47:54 from that is to extrapolate and say well
47:57 there must be some kind of necessary
47:60 reason why these laws are the way they
48:01 are That's the kind of thing that the
48:03 physicist is looking for The third
48:05 option is this sort of supernatural
48:07 intelligence Many people think that I
48:09 understand what you're saying that the
48:11 physicists can't go beyond the physical
48:13 but we can like extrapolate explanation
48:16 from the physical data right like in the
48:18 same way that if I were to look at some
48:20 evidence around me if we all left this
48:22 room and somebody came in and saw that
48:24 there were some glasses on the table and
48:25 saw that there was a book placed kind of
48:27 in the middle of the table and all this
48:29 kind of stuff They didn't see any human
48:31 beings They didn't see any agents but
48:33 they can just extrapolate from the
48:35 arrangement of of the descriptions that
48:37 they see of of the way the room is There
48:39 must have been somebody there In the
48:41 same way the physicists might not be
48:42 able to sort of look beyond the material
48:44 But can they look at the strength of the
48:47 of the strong and weak nuclear forces
48:49 and the fact that if gravity was a tiny
48:50 little bit stronger the universe would
48:52 have collapsed in on itself and a bit
48:53 weaker and everything would have flown
48:55 apart and think I can't see any evidence
48:58 of design directly but I can extrapolate
49:00 from that that there must be some kind
49:01 of intelligence behind the universe Yeah
49:03 So bear in mind number
49:06 one often people do say that if you
49:09 change the value of the physical
49:11 parameters just a little bit the
49:13 universe as we know it goes away The
49:17 problem with that is we can only do that
49:18 analysis if you change the parameters by
49:21 a little bit If you allow the parameters
49:25 to change by a lot of bit not a little
49:27 bit and you allow many of the parameters
49:29 to change simultaneously nobody can
49:31 really say what that cosmos would be
49:34 like And so it's possible that there are
49:37 patches in parameter space where you
49:40 would get different kinds of universes
49:43 that perhaps would give rise to
49:45 different living systems And then each
49:48 living system in its universe looks
49:50 around and says "Wow this universe is so
49:53 special It must be that there's some
49:56 kind of you know grand design that got
49:57 us here." But they're all saying that in
49:59 their own parameter space because
50:01 they're all making this mistake of only
50:03 looking in a small neighborhood around
50:06 the point in parameter space where they
50:07 exist So that's point number one And so
50:10 part of it is we just don't really know
50:12 enough to if we turned up gravity a
50:15 little bit and left everything else the
50:16 same I agree But if we turned it up like
50:20 to 11 that that somehow right that might
50:25 Yeah But what if you simultaneously turn
50:28 up the repulsive force that might come
50:31 from a universe with charge i mean you
50:34 it's a highly complex problem and there
50:36 might be something about turning up
50:38 gravity which necessarily also
50:41 correlatively turns up this repulsive
50:43 conceivably So so it's just a fairly
50:46 complicated problem that you don't want
50:48 to dismiss too quickly by saying it all
50:51 goes away unless it's precisely as we've
50:53 seen But it is the motivation for the
50:56 multiverse Another motivation because
50:60 one explanation simply would be there
51:02 are many many many many universes in
51:05 which the parameters of all different
51:08 values across those many
51:10 universes and in most of those universes
51:13 the conditions are not amendable to
51:15 living systems like human beings But in
51:18 one of those or a small number of those
51:20 universes the conditions are amendable
51:22 And of course we're in one of those
51:24 universes because we could not exist in
51:27 any of the others because the conditions
51:28 are not correct You know the analogy is
51:31 if you go into a clothing shop and you
51:35 want to buy a sports coat and you say "I
51:38 want to buy a sports coat." And you see
51:40 only one on the rack And the person
51:42 brings it over and it fits you perfectly
51:44 you're like "Wow that is so fortunate
51:47 that it was just the right size to fit
51:49 me." M but if you go into an actual
51:52 clothing shop when there's hundreds of
51:55 different sports jackets on the rock of
51:57 all different sizes when the person
52:00 comes and brings you one that fits
52:02 you're not surprised Of course there's
52:04 one among the many that works for you
52:06 And so if you have many jackets it's
52:09 obvious why one will fit If you have
52:11 many universes it's also pretty obvious
52:14 why one will fit the conditions
52:16 necessary to our existence And so it is
52:19 a natural way of avoiding the problem
52:23 that you're making reference to The
52:26 specialness of this universe goes away
52:28 if it's one of a grand collection of
52:30 possibilities Yeah If I went into a shop
52:33 and they had a sports jacket in just my
52:36 size I'd feel pretty pretty special I'd
52:38 feel pretty chuffed about that If I
52:40 discovered that actually they'd gone
52:42 into the back and picked from a billion
52:44 different possible suit jacket sizes uh
52:47 I'd be a little bit I'd be a little
52:49 disappointed by that I'd be kind of
52:51 upset Do you feel a bit nihilistic at
52:54 the prospect that that it seems amazing
52:57 everything is perfectly tuned for us and
52:60 that actually maybe not Maybe we just
53:02 happen to be in one of billions of
53:03 universes I guess that's not where my
53:05 selfworth comes from You know I sort of
53:08 don't look at the specialness of the
53:10 universe or my place within that special
53:12 universe
53:13 Rather what fires me up is the fact that
53:19 a collection of particles called a human
53:22 brain which is all that we are
53:24 collections of particles can coalesce
53:26 through an evolutionary dynamics to
53:30 yield a structure that can think and
53:33 feel and love and emote and create and
53:36 illuminate and figure out quantum
53:38 mechanics and figure out general
53:40 relativity and come up with the idea of
53:42 a multi verse and describe black holes
53:44 and predict the magnetic moment of the
53:47 electron And that to me is the amazing
53:49 thing that matter not infused with any
53:52 divine force not in my view structured
53:57 by some divine plan can through the bare
54:00 laws of physics come together and do
54:03 what it does
54:06 It's it's definitely marvelous
54:10 it I I do think it sort of doesn't offer
54:13 consolation in the way that that feeling
54:16 special does because I feel like
54:17 oftentimes people conflate the idea of
54:20 something being amazing with something
54:22 being like meaningful You know people
54:24 people like to say things like "Okay I I
54:26 I believe that there is just the
54:28 universe but when I look at a beautiful
54:29 night sky I'm filled with awe and
54:31 wonder." And that might be true but it
54:33 doesn't fill you with that sense of of
54:36 belonging in the same way If anything
54:37 like one person looks at the universe
54:40 and thinks it's so grand and so
54:41 brilliant that man I slot right into
54:43 this and they find their sense of
54:44 belonging Whereas some people look at
54:45 the universe they look at the same thing
54:46 and they say gosh this is also also big
54:49 and I'm just in tiny little random
54:52 neighborhood like oh I I I have no place
54:53 here I'm just randomly here Like which
54:56 of those do you identify with more when
54:59 you look at the universe they're both
55:01 true right right i mean I fundamentally
55:04 believe that there is no cosmic purpose
55:09 There is no cosmic meaning I do believe
55:12 and I'm open as we discussed to other
55:15 ideas ultimately replacing this
55:17 perspective if it made sense and if
55:19 there was evidence but I fundamentally
55:20 believe that we are the product of
55:24 physical processes and that we are
55:26 physical structures and that these
55:28 physical structures just come together
55:30 for a brief moment of time and then we
55:33 disperse and for that brief moment of
55:35 time can I feel alone and nihilistic yes
55:39 can I feel connected and thrilled yes
55:43 Can I hold both of those ideas in mind
55:45 simultaneously yes And I do And so yes
55:49 at times do I feel completely at sea in
55:53 this gigantic cosmos crawling around on
55:56 this nondescript planet going around
55:59 this ordinary star in the outskirts of
56:02 the Milky Way galaxy yes Can that make
56:05 you feel small and lacking some sense of
56:08 purpose for sure But at the same time
56:11 when I think about the fact that we've
56:13 developed these mathematical ideas that
56:16 describe that reality it gives me a
56:19 feeling of connection to that reality I
56:22 feel closer to the universe when I have
56:24 a deep description that at least
56:27 approximates some of the processes that
56:29 take place General relativity makes me
56:31 feel closer to the cosmos as does
56:33 quantum mechanics And so yes alone and
56:36 yes connected all together in one human
56:39 mind that somehow is able to grapple
56:41 with these
56:43 ideas this multiverse situation that we
56:47 were talking about
56:48 before do we have good reason to think
56:50 that it might be the case outside of a
56:52 its possibility and b the way that it
56:55 kind of conveniently does away with the
56:57 trouble of things like fine-tuning or
56:59 the the trillions of ways that string
57:02 theory dimensions could be folded in on
57:04 themselves because like you imagined
57:08 walking into a jacket shop and finding
57:09 one that was perfect and I'm imagining
57:11 walking into a jacket shop and and and
57:13 and it's just like a tiny little little
57:15 store you somewhere in somewhere in New
57:17 York on like the second floor right and
57:19 it just has a few jackets and and a few
57:21 pairs of trousers and I try on this
57:22 jacket and it is like perfect I mean
57:26 it's the exact shade of blue that I was
57:28 looking for I send it to my camera guy
57:30 and he does the little hex code and he's
57:32 like "Man this is like exactly the right
57:34 color temperature The the sleeves are
57:36 the perfect length like uncannily
57:38 perfect Like everything is great." It's
57:40 even got like a name tag from the
57:42 previous owner that says Alex on it just
57:45 by pure And I think man this is
57:47 absolutely unbelievable I'm saying to my
57:49 friend "This is unbelievable I can't
57:50 believe every single time I look at it
57:52 something new that just just
57:53 unfathomably coincidental." And the
57:56 friend says "Okay this is amazing I what
57:59 must have
58:00 happened is that there are actually like
58:03 an infinite number of jackets that are
58:05 sort of sat in the back and every time
58:08 somebody comes into the shop they sort
58:10 of bring one out by chance and hope that
58:13 it's a match And I suppose we must all
58:15 sort of have sort of existed in New York
58:17 for an infinite amount of time so that
58:19 this guarantees that at least once this
58:20 goes right And of course you're going to
58:22 be the one that gets it right because
58:24 otherwise you wouldn't be having this
58:25 amazing experience
58:27 Compared to just what I naively
58:29 experience which is like one room and a
58:31 jacket which fits perfectly I would I
58:34 would basically ask that friend to give
58:37 me more reason outside of the
58:39 convenience of explaining this
58:40 coincidence to believe in that infinite
58:43 set of jackets to to think that it's
58:45 actually true right i I mean and then in
58:47 in the end of the day that's really what
58:50 we do We try to explain the confluence
58:54 of data that seems to lock together with
58:58 such a gratifying and impressive
59:01 cohesion just like your perfect jacket
59:04 you know inscribed in just the right way
59:06 And this is that jacket It's beautiful I
59:09 I agree with our cameraman And and so
59:11 what we try to do is to write down
59:13 equations that will give us some insight
59:15 into how it could be that there's a
59:18 process that starts in the big bang and
59:21 results in the things that we are now
59:24 experiencing Now are there certain
59:26 things that might be pure coincidence
59:29 like could it be pure coincidence that
59:31 the gravitational constant and the
59:33 electromagnetic force have just the
59:35 right values to yield the qualities that
59:38 allow us to exist it could be
59:41 coincidental It could be really
59:44 causitative It could have been had the
59:46 values been different they would have
59:47 caused something else and that something
59:50 else if it had consciousness might be in
59:53 the same quandry saying why were the
59:56 constants just the right value to allow
59:58 me to exist and yet they'd be different
59:60 than the constants that we have And so
60:02 you have to be careful about seeing
60:06 things and being impressed at their
60:10 uniqueness when they might not be unique
60:13 and impressed at how they are designed
60:16 when they may not be designed They
60:18 simply may be what they are and you are
60:21 the result of those features They
60:24 weren't set in order to get you to exist
60:28 They were set maybe by some random
60:30 process and you are the output of that
60:32 random process What we do as conscious
60:35 beings we tend to look at our
60:37 environment and try to explain it in
60:41 terms that somehow give us a a narrative
60:45 a story And we love stories that somehow
60:48 have a purpose But these stories may not
60:51 have a purpose It may just be random
60:53 events with random numbers that yield
60:56 based on their structure certain outputs
60:59 And we may be the output of those random
61:01 qualities So at risk of belaboring the
61:04 point because we're speaking quite
61:06 generally here in particular the
61:08 multiverse like I say outside of
61:11 this convenient explanation of of
61:14 certain phenomena but not in such a way
61:17 that it's like you know a predictable
61:20 testable hypothesis just this makes some
61:22 sense of of what we see do we have good
61:24 evidence outside of that for the
61:26 multiverse when I spoke to David Deutsch
61:28 he was firmly convinced I mean he said
61:30 he doesn't believe in the multiverse he
61:32 knows that the multiverse exists from
61:35 sort of a quantum perspective He's a
61:36 many worlds interpretation type guy So
61:38 very particular kind of uh of multiverse
61:41 but he just thought that we had this
61:43 evidence It wasn't just a way of
61:45 explaining difficult quandries Do you
61:48 believe in the same way that we have
61:50 like evidence for the multiverse or do
61:52 you tend to just treat it as a potential
61:54 hypothesis to to do away with these
61:56 problems yeah I I absolutely do not
61:59 think we have evidence for the
62:00 multiverse and I believe I understand
62:04 David Deutsche's perspective I I
62:07 actually never met him but I have read
62:09 his books And of course I'm deeply
62:12 familiar with the many worlds approach
62:13 to quantum mechanics And it is a
62:17 compelling mathematical framework that
62:20 we humans invented to describe these
62:24 strange processes in the microscopic
62:27 realm Is it the only description of the
62:31 microscopic realm that we have no There
62:34 are other ways of talking about the
62:37 phenomenon of quantum mechanics where
62:39 you don't mention the word multiverse
62:42 You don't mention many worlds And as of
62:45 today we don't know of a way to
62:48 experimentally distinguish between these
62:51 different approaches So I think it's far
62:53 too early to say that the many worlds
62:57 the multiverse version of quantum
62:59 mechanics is correct And that's only one
63:01 flavor of multiverse There are many ways
63:05 in which you come upon this idea of many
63:08 universes You come upon it
63:10 cosmologically from inflationary
63:12 cosmology with multiple big bangs You
63:15 come upon it in string theory with many
63:18 different possible shapes for the extra
63:20 dimensions You come upon also within
63:22 string theory with something called
63:23 brain universes So there are many
63:25 flavors of multiverse that science has
63:28 bumped into Absolutely none of them are
63:32 at a level of understanding where we can
63:35 say yes there is evidence for the
63:38 multiverse No there is mathematical
63:42 motivation based upon our attempts to
63:45 understand things in the external world
63:47 but it is mathematical motivation for
63:50 thinking about the possibility of a
63:51 multiverse Yes I keep it in my toolkit
63:54 as an interesting possibility that you
63:57 break out when you don't have any other
63:60 way of describing what it is that you're
64:02 seeing Yeah Is that similar to how
64:04 string theory works though like I mean
64:06 we were talking before about how string
64:08 theory is mathematically elegant and
64:11 makes sense of some phenomena that we
64:13 see like the graviton and this kind of
64:14 stuff but we don't have any experimental
64:16 confirmation the way that you've just
64:18 described the multiverse is something
64:19 you keep it in the back pocket but I
64:22 don't think we have good evidence to
64:23 believe it's true
64:25 Yeah Are these sort of similar i would
64:27 say it depends which pocket theory is in
64:31 So yes multiverse back pocket String
64:34 theory is like right here right and the
64:36 reason and the reason for that is to put
64:39 quantum mechanics and general relativity
64:41 together We know we've got to do that
64:43 and string theory does that You know the
64:45 idea that general relativity as we
64:47 discussed emerges from string theory
64:49 It's a real powerful way of thinking
64:52 about why this theory might be the way
64:55 to put these two together It may be that
64:57 general relativity is intrinsically
64:59 within string theory from the get-go And
65:02 there's another story just like that for
65:04 quantum physics within string theory So
65:07 that's why it's here But yes I agree
65:09 That's your jacket pocket not the half
65:11 That's wrong That's the correct size Yes
65:13 I did me in the jack of pocket Until you
65:16 have experimental evidence for
65:17 mathematical ideas they do need to be
65:20 viewed as provisional But I think I
65:23 would put string theory one step closer
65:26 to connection with physics than the
65:28 general idea of a multiverse 25 years
65:32 ago the elegant universe is published
65:34 introducing a lot of people uh for the
65:37 first time to string theory How has your
65:40 confidence in string theory fluctuated
65:43 since then yeah So look 25 years ago I
65:49 would have thought that the conversation
65:52 we're having right now would focus upon
65:54 all the experiments that have been done
65:57 that connected to some of the
65:60 predictions of string theory Predictions
66:02 about God That's right That's right you
66:04 know predictions about super symmetric
66:06 particles and things like that That
66:08 didn't happen And yes is that a
66:11 disappointment i I'd have to say
66:13 honestly it is a
66:14 disappointment But on the mathematical
66:17 front 25 years ago if you ask me will we
66:21 understand the fundamental exact
66:24 equations of string theory in any domain
66:26 i say no We'll only still have
66:27 approximate equations We have exact
66:29 equations in particular domains right
66:31 now Will we have a way of talking about
66:35 space and time in a radically new
66:37 language than Einstein's general theory
66:40 of relativity i said well it' be nice
66:41 but I I don't think we have that
66:43 language now that's emerging from these
66:45 studies And I could go on and on with
66:47 the mathematical progress that exceeds
66:51 anything I would have imagined 25 years
66:53 ago So that has certainly increased my
66:56 confidence in the capacity of these
66:58 ideas to really give us a rich
67:00 description of reality But again I would
67:03 have hoped that we would have the
67:05 observations that would at least
67:07 tentatively connect with some of the
67:09 ideas of string theory and that we've
67:11 not been able to do It was going to
67:13 cancel out such that roughly speaking
67:15 you're about as confident as you were
67:17 cuz it sort of sounds like string theory
67:19 is awesome and great but like yeah it
67:22 could be could be false It's as you say
67:24 it's sort of in the jacket pocket Yeah
67:26 Is that where it was 25 years ago as
67:27 well well again I think part of it is
67:30 the psychological question of a youthful
67:33 physicist Yeah Looking at the world as
67:36 you know this
67:37 spectacular landscape of discovery
67:40 versus a somewhat I'd like to think more
67:42 mature perspective on reality which is a
67:45 little bit more subdued And so yes when
67:48 you put those together I would say the
67:50 level of confidence is fairly close but
67:54 that's an amazing thing in its own right
67:56 The fact that these string theoretic
67:59 ideas have been subjected to an
68:01 additional quarter century of
68:04 mathematical investigation by some of
68:06 the greatest minds that this planet has
68:08 ever produced And I'm not putting myself
68:09 in that category I'm talking about
68:11 string theorists as a community and the
68:13 theory have stood up to these
68:16 mathematical assaults and has yielded
68:19 riches that are completely unexpected
68:21 and enormously gratifying That that is
68:25 amazing That is not something that's
68:28 minor That is a major step in the
68:30 direction of developing an idea that may
68:33 well be the correct description of
68:34 reality And if we wake up tomorrow and
68:36 discover that this is the correct
68:38 description of reality somebody has
68:39 somehow experimentally confirmed string
68:43 theory what does that change does it
68:46 change much outside of just our
68:50 understanding hey isn't that interesting
68:52 does it change the way that I live my
68:53 life does it change the the clothes that
68:55 I wear or what time of I I get out of
68:57 bed in the morning or anything like that
68:58 it's always difficult to answer a
69:00 question like that in real time But I
69:03 think quantum mechanics gives us a
69:05 beautiful case study where we can look
69:06 at it over a longer stretch of time
69:09 because if you were talking to Erin
69:10 Schroinger Neil's Boore right now it was
69:14 19 20 something 23 24 you say look if
69:19 this quantum mechanics thing pans out
69:22 and it really is experimentally
69:24 confirmed will that change my life will
69:27 it change when I get up in the morning i
69:29 think they would have said "Look we're
69:31 talking about atoms and particles and if
69:34 that isn't the kind of thing that
69:37 determines how you live your life then
69:39 probably quantum mechanics will not have
69:41 a big impact on you." And yet here we
69:44 are 100red years later And because of
69:47 quantum mechanics we have been able to
69:50 control matter harness matter on
69:53 microscopic scales yielding the
69:54 integrated circuit yielding all manner
69:58 of technological progress The fact that
70:00 you have a cell phone the fact that you
70:02 have a personal computer the fact that
70:04 you have any kind of technological
70:06 device is because of the work of quantum
70:09 mechanics So has it affected how you get
70:12 up in the morning yeah Now when you say
70:14 hey Siri 8:00 wakeup call that is
70:17 because of quantum mechanics
70:18 fundamentally speaking and so could the
70:21 same thing happen with string theory if
70:24 it's correct will we be able to harness
70:26 matter in new ways and do things that I
70:30 can't even imagine today yeah I can
70:32 imagine that possibility yeah that's
70:33 interesting people often probably
70:36 neglect to think about that when it
70:37 comes to the utility of of physics I
70:39 mean there's a big debate about how many
70:41 resources the government should put into
70:43 space travel or science or whatever And
70:46 there is quite a myopic view that this
70:49 is not worth this particular project
70:51 It's not worth this amount of time or
70:53 money to work out if you know this this
70:56 book is made of strings or particles Who
70:59 cares forgetting that there are always
71:01 unforeseen consequences of these
71:03 physical theories Yeah absolutely You
71:06 know there's uh some calculations that
71:08 suggest and it's pretty obvious if you
71:10 think about it you know a significant
71:12 fraction of the gross national product
71:16 of any
71:19 major nation on this planet can be
71:22 traced back to quantum physics Mhm And
71:26 so I don't like that as the main
71:28 motivation for doing science because it
71:30 then suggests that we should just do
71:32 applied physics applied because it seems
71:34 like that's the justification and the
71:36 motivation Whereas even with quantum
71:38 mechanics it was not applied physics
71:40 when people were developing Schroinger's
71:42 equation or Heisenberg's uncertainty
71:44 principle It's the fundamental ideas
71:47 which later generations can take over
71:50 and then apply So you don't start
71:53 applying you start fundamental But yeah
71:55 can these ideas change how we live
71:58 absolutely I wanted to ask you in the
72:00 time
72:02 remaining a a question which mystifies
72:04 me which is what on earth the time
72:07 remaining
72:09 means I I listen to people talk about
72:14 the discovery of particles and forces
72:17 and that somehow forces can express
72:20 themselves at fundamental levels as
72:22 particles That to me seems kind of
72:24 strange that gravity can be a kind of
72:25 particle But okay I believe
72:28 you
72:29 Time I just don't even know what it is I
72:32 don't know if it's a if it's a force a
72:35 particle a substance I don't know if it
72:37 exists
72:39 when you think of time when you're
72:40 describing time to somebody just crudely
72:43 speaking what what image is in your head
72:45 like how are you conceiving of this
72:47 thing called time so the first thing I
72:49 should say is I also do not know what
72:52 time is and I don't think any of us do
72:56 is it something that we humans impose on
72:58 the external world just to organize our
73:00 perceptions into some coherent narrative
73:03 is time more than that is it
73:05 fundamentally stitched into the fabric
73:07 of reality ity Are there realms of
73:10 reality where there is no conception of
73:12 time at all and it just exists in a way
73:15 that doesn't change in the manner that
73:17 we usually think of when we're talking
73:19 about dynamical changes through time i I
73:22 don't know and nobody does But how then
73:24 do I think about it pretty much the way
73:26 you think about it I think of time as
73:29 something that allows for change Time is
73:33 the environment within which things can
73:37 differ at one moment versus another And
73:40 in fact the way we note that time has
73:43 evolved is by comparing things Whether
73:47 it's the second hand on a clock the
73:49 readout on your iPhone or the color of
73:52 my hair 25 years later compared to what
73:55 it was when I was much younger That's
73:57 how we mark the passage of time by
73:60 virtue of change But is time more than
74:04 that i don't know Well most physical
74:07 mathematical calculations work in both
74:09 directions right like if you take almost
74:11 anything and just reverse it as if time
74:13 was going backwards It all works out the
74:15 same So it's very difficult to discover
74:17 why there is this arrow of time that
74:19 that takes us from from past to future
74:22 And it feels like it does take us there
74:24 I can get up and walk forward or back or
74:27 I can stand still but I can't do that
74:30 with time Even though I'm told time is a
74:32 dimension a bit like those other spaces
74:34 which I can I can manipulate I I find it
74:38 impossible to to wrap my head around But
74:40 also when somebody says maybe time is
74:42 just an illusion or something we impose
74:45 into the world that doesn't make sense
74:46 to me either because I think well to
74:48 impose something is something that's
74:49 turned through time you know and
74:53 so I don't I don't think I recognize
74:56 that possibility The idea that that that
74:58 time is some kind of human construction
75:02 Is is that what you were sort of
75:03 suggesting it it it could well be or it
75:06 could be deeper But the problems that
75:08 you're referring to are real ones and we
75:11 have made progress on at least some of
75:13 them In terms of the arrow of time why
75:16 does it seem to have a direction when as
75:18 you rightly say the laws of physics as
75:20 currently constructed they're agnostic
75:24 between what we call forward in time and
75:25 backward in time they work in both
75:27 directions equally well And we believe
75:29 it has to do with entropy this idea of
75:32 disorder And we believe that entropy has
75:35 this tendency to increase over time And
75:38 we furthermore anticipate we can't prove
75:42 that the big bang was a state of
75:44 incredibly low entropy very high order
75:48 And we have been living through the
75:49 degradation of that order for the last
75:52 13 billion years So why when you drop a
75:56 glass and it
75:57 shatters doesn't it unshatter we believe
76:01 because the glass is carrying forward
76:03 that drive toward greater disorder it
76:06 could unshhatter at least in principle
76:09 It's just so incredibly unlikely because
76:12 to go from disorder to order is a very
76:15 difficult maneuver To go from order to
76:17 disorder that's very simple Just drop
76:20 the glass and it shatters And so that at
76:22 least gives us some insight into why
76:24 there is this direction to time But if
76:27 you step back and say but what about
76:29 time itself like why is there this thing
76:32 called time and why is it different from
76:34 space why can we so freely navigate
76:36 through space left and right back it
76:38 doesn't matter There's no constraint Why
76:40 is there this constraint on time i can't
76:44 really give you an answer to that
76:45 question And you can conceive of space
76:47 but you can't conceive of time in the
76:49 same way It does make me wonder if there
76:50 is a similar kind of like fine-tuning
76:53 problem for time Of course time ticks
76:57 differently if you're near a mass of
76:59 gravity or if you're traveling close to
77:00 the speed of light but presumably
77:03 there's some kind of like ratio by which
77:06 as the mass increases of a gravitational
77:08 object the time dilation increases Yeah
77:11 we have a formula for it Presumably that
77:13 is something that you could also like
77:15 tweak in principle where as the mass
77:17 increases you know the time ticks
77:20 proportionally even more slowly than it
77:22 actually does right now And so 1 - 2 GM
77:24 over C ^2 R You I mean that's the we
77:26 actually have a formula for words out of
77:28 my mouth That's right Uh and and so I
77:32 suppose what I'm just wondering here is
77:33 when we talk about this like fine-tuning
77:35 argument for God's existence or like
77:37 multiverse type stuff is time one of
77:39 those qualities because it seems to me
77:41 like unnatural to think of it in that
77:42 way because I think of time almost as if
77:45 almost as the space in which all of
77:47 that's happening But is there also this
77:49 finetuning of the way that time works i
77:53 think that gets closer to a
77:56 psychological question as opposed to a
77:59 scientific one in the sense of the
78:02 fundamental nature of time I think we
78:04 beings have these structures and these
78:06 structures in our heads change on
78:09 certain time scales and those time
78:11 scales evolved and so were the mass of
78:15 Earth very different or if we were on
78:18 Miller's planet orbiting gargantua in a
78:21 black you know would it be perhaps that
78:23 we would evolve differently and our
78:25 sense of time would be different sure I
78:27 mean I mean to say that like the the
78:30 fact that if I so say say I
78:33 uh doubled say I'm orbiting a black hole
78:36 and I I then double the mass of the
78:37 black hole there will be some proportion
78:40 by which the time dilation increases I'm
78:42 imagining a world in which for that the
78:44 laws of physics are tweaked such that
78:45 when I double it time dilates in the
78:49 opposite direction let's say let's say
78:50 that when you go towards a a black hole
78:52 instead of time slowing down it speeds
78:54 up like I don't know if there's anything
78:57 in principle preventing the laws of
78:59 physics from having been that way but
79:00 presumably that would cause all kinds of
79:02 problems for the harmony of the universe
79:04 analogous to how if you turned up the
79:07 the strong nuclear force everything
79:08 would fall apart Sure I I think that's
79:11 absolutely true But the one thing I
79:12 would emphasize is when it comes to
79:16 special relativity time dilation going
79:18 near the speed of light and time slowing
79:20 for you relative to somebody else or
79:22 general relativistic time dilation You
79:24 go near a black hole and time elapses
79:25 slower for you than it does for somebody
79:27 far away You don't notice that Yeah
79:30 Because it's time itself according to
79:33 these ideas that is slowing which means
79:36 that all physical processes that take
79:38 place in time slow down So your watch
79:42 slows but your thoughts also slow So
79:45 from your perspective nothing has
79:47 changed And so yes could it be that you
79:50 would disrupt the structure of reality
79:53 if you had the qualities that you're
79:55 making reference to sure I can certainly
79:57 imagine that But bear in mind it's not
79:59 the individual that their experience
80:02 somehow changes It's only by comparison
80:05 to two widely separated individuals or
80:09 widely differing in their motion
80:11 individuals where these differences will
80:13 emerge The individual doesn't realize it
80:15 at all Well I do seem to realize an
80:19 increase in speed of time when I'm
80:21 having an enjoyable conversation and
